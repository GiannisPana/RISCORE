# **RISCORE**:
*Enhancing In-Context Riddle Solving in Language Models through Context-Reconstructed Example Augmentation*

## Abstract:
We address the complex challenge of riddle-solving with large language models (LLMs), a task that demands a blend of abstract thinking, creative problem-solving, and diverse reasoning skills. LLMs often struggle in these areas, but our method, **RISCORE**, aims to overcome these limitations by improving in-context riddle-solving performance.

## Key Contributions:

- **Novel Prompting Method:**  
  We introduce **RISCORE** (**RI**ddle **S**olving with **CO**ntext **RE**construction), a unique prompting technique designed to boost LLMs' riddle-solving capabilities. It incorporates an automated pipeline to generate contextually reconstructed multiple-choice riddles, enhancing the modelâ€™s understanding and performance.

- **Improved Reasoning with Context:**  
  Our experiments demonstrate that providing a riddle along with its context reconstruction significantly enhances performance in both lateral and vertical thinking tasks, facilitating better problem-solving across diverse reasoning challenges.

- **Comprehensive Comparisons:**  
  RISCORE is rigorously evaluated against a wide range of popular prompting techniques. It consistently outperforms these alternatives across multiple models of varying sizes, showcasing its robustness and versatility.
